# Introduction

This specification documentation is written for the front-end user interface of the survey form software - “A Small World of Singlish Words: A Word Association Study”. The report is broken down into three parts - [Maintainers’ Guide](/front-end/maintainer-guide), [Developer Guide](/front-end/developer-guide), and [Quality Assurance](/front-end/quality-assurance).

[The Maintainer’s Guide](/front-end/maintainer-guide) provides future maintainers with information on how to maintain the survey form. Basic HTML and coding knowledge is required. Specifically, maintainers should have a basic understanding of HTML tags and data types in Javascript.

[The Developer Guide](/front-end/developer-guide) elaborates on the technical specifications of the front-end interface. Prior experience in React is assumed of readers reading this section.

[The Quality Assurance](/front-end/quality-assurance) section provides information on the various test cases that the survey form should pass before the form is deployed for public data collection.
